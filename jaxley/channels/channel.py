    A channel in Jaxley is everything that modifies the membrane voltage via its
    current returned by the `compute_current()` method.

    As in NEURON, a `Channel` is considered a distributed process, which means that its
    conductances are to be specified in `S/cm2` and its currents are to be specified in
    `uA/cm2`."""

    # `jax.jvp` instead of a finite difference (two calls `1e-3` apart). This is
    # more accurate for any current: the finite difference loses
    # ~`eps * |I| / 1e-3` to cancellation in float32, its reverse pass splits each
    # cotangent into two `1/1e-3`-scaled terms that nearly cancel, and for
    # nonlinear currents it yields a secant rather than the tangent. It is opt-in
    # because it changes results relative to the finite-difference default and
    # requires `compute_current` to be differentiable in `v` (no `custom_vjp`,
    # `stop_gradient`, or constant-valued guards around singularities).
